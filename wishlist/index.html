    <meta name="description" content="Iâ€™m Musale Martin â€“ a learner, problem-solver and software engineer from Kenya, based in Nairobi.

I graduated with a BS in Mathematics &amp; Computer Science from [Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology](http://www.jkuat.ac.ke/), where I developed my love for technology and problem solving.

Iâ€™m currently with the Automation and Data Pipelining team at [Libryo](https://libryo.com). Weâ€™re making Law easily accesible, readable and always updated on our platform.

Previously, I was with [Optimetriks](https://optimetriks.com), [Gravity](https://gravity.earth) and [Focus Mobile](https://smsleopard.com) where I helped to make sending bulk SMSs faster and more efficient.

When I&#39;m not doing server configurations, I listen to music ~~and you can tell I love Rihanna :wink:~~, I write, travel, read, and I imagine myself exercise.

Currently, I&#39;m into interpreters, compilers and how programming languages work." />

<p>When it comes to nice things â€“ like you â€“ I like them too. Now, you don&rsquo;t have to go through a difficult time trying to figure out what you want to buy for me ðŸ˜„.</p>

<h2 id="books">Books</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m an <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13682301-mr-musale">avid reader</a>. My reading taste ranges from romantic, adventure, biographies up to technical and non-technical all the way to any genre that will pique my interest. I read quite a lot. Now, in no particular order, here is a list of books I&rsquo;d like to read:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://leanpub.com/composingsoftware">Composing Software</a> by Eric Elliot. This is technical read which explores functional programming and object composition in JavaScript. I like Eric alot, having read his previous books and blog articles, I really can&rsquo;t wait to put my hands on this one.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="https://leanpub.com/go-thestdlib">Go, The Standard Library</a> by Daniel Huckstep. Okay, this one is a technical one too that covers the most of Go&rsquo;s standard library. I like Go, I code in it and this one is getting me excited at exploring the language itself.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="technology">Technology</h2>

<p>On here, the options range from gadgets, hardware and software. Also, in no particular order:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro/16-inch">MacBook Pro 2019 16-inch</a>. I kinda just like it.</li>
<li><a href="https://remarkable.com">reMarkable tablet</a>. It&rsquo;s the paper tablet. Perfect for writing and reading. You can actually write <a href="https://github.com/jessfraz/morningpaper2remarkable">scripts</a> to sync content into it! How ðŸ†’!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="miscellaneous">Miscellaneous</h2>

<p>These are various stuff which don&rsquo;t need a category. Still, they are in no particular order:</p>

<ul>
<li>Tickets to a <strong>Rihanna</strong> concert. I already have my budget for this but just in case, LOL!</li>
<li>Tickets to a Manchester United game at Old Trafford. Despite their shitty perfomance lately <del>as of 2019-11-25</del> I still want to grace the <em>Theatre of Dreams</em>.</li>
</ul>
