      <description>Motivation I bumped into Ben Hoyt&amp;rsquo;s website during my rounds on the internet. I liked the way the website is laid out. Since I have been looking for a proper layout for my personal website, I found the site to be exactly what I wanted. The reason I made it into a hugo theme is because I used it for my site and it would be good to have one of them themes.</description>

&lt;p&gt;I bumped into &lt;a href=&#34;https://benhoyt.com/&#34;&gt;Ben Hoyt&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; website during my rounds on the internet. I liked the way the website is laid out. Since I have been looking for a proper layout for my personal website, I found the site to be exactly what I wanted. The reason I made it into a &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io&#34;&gt;hugo&lt;/a&gt; theme is because I used it for my site and it would be good to have one of them themes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;results&#34;&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I created a hugo theme named &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/musale/hoyt&#34;&gt;hoyt&lt;/a&gt; &lt;del&gt;for obvious reasons, d&amp;rsquo;uh&lt;/del&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s still a work in progress and contributions are welcome in accordance to the standard guidelines of contributing to OSS. I&amp;rsquo;m looking to add more features and hopefully make this into a fully-fledged theme but for the time being, my fingers are crossed.&lt;/p&gt;
