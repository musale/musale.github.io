      <description>In &lt;a href=&#34;https://musale.github.io/thoughts/best-of-decade/&#34;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt;, I reflect on some of the best things and moments that I had in the decade 2010-2019. It&amp;rsquo;s been a wonderful 10 years full of ups and downs and in as much as I would like to have a balanced view of both, I choose to stick with the positive things that happened to me and that I can remember.</description>
