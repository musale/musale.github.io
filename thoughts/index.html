         <meta name="description" content="Iâ€™m Musale Martin â€“ a learner, problem-solver, and software engineer from Kenya, based in Nairobi.

I graduated with a BS in Mathematics &amp; Computer Science from [Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology](http://www.jkuat.ac.ke/), where I developed my love for technology and problem-solving.

Iâ€™m currently with the Automation and Data Pipelining team at [Libryo](https://libryo.com). Weâ€™re helping businesses to know their regulations by collecting, tagging, summarising, and giving them notifications when it changes.

Previously, I was with [Optimetriks](https://optimetriks.com), [Gravity](https://gravity.earth), and [Focus Mobile](https://smsleopard.com) â€“ where I helped to make sending bulk SMSs faster and more efficient.

When I&#39;m not programming the web, I listen to music ~~and you can tell I love Rihanna~~ ðŸ˜‰, I [write](/thoughts), travel, [read](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13682301-mr-musale), and I imagine myself exercise.

Currently, I&#39;m into interpreters, how programming languages work, and distributed systems.">

       In <a href="/thoughts/best-of-decade/">this article</a>, I reflect on some of the best things and moments that I had in the decade 2010-2019. It&rsquo;s been a wonderful 10 years full of ups and downs and in as much as I would like to have a balanced view of both, I choose to stick with the positive things that happened to me and that I can remember. 
    </li>
    
    <li>
       <a href="/thoughts/aoc19/">The Advent of Code 2019</a> has my thoughts about the daily <a href="https://adventofcode.com/">exercises</a> which I&rsquo;m currently attempting to solve with both <em>Go</em> and <em>Python 3</em>. 
    </li>
    
    <li>
       <a href="/thoughts/http3/">HTTP/3 and it&rsquo;s underlying protocol QUIC</a> talks about the new HTTP/3 layer and the underlying protocol QUIC. It&rsquo;s from the very nice read by Daniel Haxx called <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/http3-explained">HTTP/3 Explained</a> â€“ which you should read as it details the processes, how it works and what the future holds for HTPP/3 and QUIC.
