<p>I always like solving problems and this is a very nice place to practise my skills. This year, I would like to learn more concepts and I&rsquo;m already liking this <em>AOC</em>. For starters, we have a lot of participation and people are streaming when they&rsquo;re solving the puzzles. I like the way <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuWLIm0l4sDpEe28t41WITA/videos">Jonathan Paulson&rsquo;s</a> videos are done. They are precise and really nice to see. He&rsquo;s fast too and that makes me want to look and think through a puzzle with his level of understanding and speed. I also like <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/lizthegrey">Liz Fong-Jones'</a> <em>Go</em> solutions. My solutions are over <a href="https://github.com/musale/advent-of-code-2019">here</a>.</p>

<p>The <code>IntCode</code> makes a come back but we are prepared :fork_and_knife:! I liked this puzzle because in as much as you needed to rethink how you fetch the modes, that was all there was. In the second part it was a matter of changing the inputs and boom! Very easy and almost, just the way I like it.</p>
<p>For me, I have the most of this <code>IntCode</code> solutions in Python. What I would like to do is to port it to <code>Go</code>.</p>
<h2 id="day-8">Day 8<a href="#day-8" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>Decoding the image data was pretty easy. It involved array manipulation so from a higher level you can see the kind of problem that you have and the way the ideal solution needs to look like. For my case, I knew that I need a way to keep layers, which I did using a <code>dict</code>. To find the layer with the most common <code>zeros</code>, I used Python&rsquo;s <code>collections.Counter</code> to find the count of value 0 and set the lowest value for each layer. Pretty easy.</p>
<p>For the second part, I looped through the size of an image (<code>width * height</code>) and then the value which is not 2 in a second loop through the layers. This enabled me to look at the previous layer data as I went through looking for a pixel value that&rsquo;s not 2.</p>
<p>Printing the value to get what text it looks like was an awesome task. I got this:</p>
<pre><code>####.###..####.#..#.###..
#....#..#....#.#..#.#..#.
###..###....#..#..#.#..#.
#....#..#..#...#..#.###..
#....#..#.#....#..#.#.#..
####.###..####..##..#..#.
</code></pre>
<p>Looking towards day #9!</p>
<h2 id="day-7">Day 7<a href="#day-7" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p><strong>Amplifiers</strong>! This puzzle builds up from the <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/5">day 5</a> <code>IntCode</code> puzzle. There&rsquo;s multi processing in part 2 which really had me in a mind blown state. For some reason <del>which I don&rsquo;t know</del> I just find it difficult understanding the int code puzzles. I managed to do the first part but translating that to part 2 became a bit of a challenge. One thing I learnt how to tackle it was to make the code I&rsquo;m running more clear. I came across a solution by <a href="https://github.com/alcatrazEscapee/AdventofCode/blob/master/2019/day7/day7.py">alcatrazEscapee</a> and reading through his code made me understand the puzzle even better. I hope day 8 is easy on me :laugh:.</p>
<h2 id="day-6">Day 6<a href="#day-6" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>Yay! A simple puzzle. We had ourselves a tree and traversals. This was a bit easy to do. Also, the illustrations make it really easy to think through your solutions.</p>
<h2 id="day-5">Day 5<a href="#day-5" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p><strong>Good Lord!</strong> This is by far the most difficult of the puzzles. For starters, it uses day 2&rsquo;s code. Then the theory is just a lot. My brain got lost for a couple of hours here. I finally followed Jonathan Paulson&rsquo;s steps and managed to finesse it. Sigh</p>
<h2 id="day-1---4">Day 1 - 4<a href="#day-1---4" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>These exercises were pretty simple and straightforward. <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/1">Day 1</a> exercises involved summing values, pretty easy. <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/2">Day 2</a> had some splitting values given a certain step and then doing different arithmetic and end up with a final value. That was pretty easy to do too.</p>
<p><a href="https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/3">Day 3</a> came with Manhattan distance. Owh, this one was nice&hellip; I&rsquo;m still unable to do the visualizations and it&rsquo;s one thing that I found out people are doing with their solutions. It&rsquo;s fantastic seeing people doing these.</p>
<p><a href="https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/4">Day 4</a> was <em>brute force</em> day. Genarating values in a given range and using different criteria to determine the values you need and then make a final value.</p>
