      <description>In &lt;a href=&#34;https://musale.github.io/thoughts/best-of-decade/&#34;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt;, I reflect on some of the best things and moments that I had in the decade 2010-2019. It&amp;rsquo;s been a wonderful 10 years full of ups and downs and in as much as I would like to have a balanced view of both, I choose to stick with the positive things that happened to me and that I can remember.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&#34;https://musale.github.io/thoughts/aoc19/&#34;&gt;The Advent of Code 2019&lt;/a&gt; has my thoughts about the daily &lt;a href=&#34;https://adventofcode.com/&#34;&gt;exercises&lt;/a&gt; which I&amp;rsquo;m currently attempting to solve with both &lt;em&gt;Go&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Python 3&lt;/em&gt;.</description>

      <title>HTTP/3 and it&#39;s underlying protocol QUIC</title>
      <link>https://musale.github.io/thoughts/http3/</link>

      <description>&lt;a href=&#34;https://musale.github.io/thoughts/http3/&#34;&gt;HTTP/3 and it&amp;rsquo;s underlying protocol QUIC&lt;/a&gt; talks about the new HTTP/3 layer and the underlying protocol QUIC. It&amp;rsquo;s from the very nice read by Daniel Haxx called &lt;a href=&#34;https://daniel.haxx.se/http3-explained&#34;&gt;HTTP/3 Explained&lt;/a&gt; â€“ which you should read as it details the processes, how it works and what the future holds for HTPP/3 and QUIC.</description>
