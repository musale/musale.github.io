         <meta name="description" content="Iâ€™m Musale Martin â€“ a learner, problem-solver, and software engineer from Kenya, based in Nairobi.

I&#39;m currently building ~~and breaking~~ software at Microsoft in the M365 team.

I was previously with the Automation and Data Pipelining team at [Libryo](https://libryo.com). We were helping businesses to know their regulations by collecting, tagging, summarising, and giving them notifications about the law when it changes.

Before that, I was with [Optimetriks](https://optimetriks.com), [Gravity](https://gravity.earth), and [Focus Mobile](https://smsleopard.com) â€“ where I helped to make sending bulk SMSs faster and more efficient.

In my free time, I contribute to open source projects. I&#39;m a maintainer at [Encode](https://www.encode.io/) where we aim to develop the highest quality open-source software. At the moment I&#39;m mostly programming in [Python](https://python.org) and [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org/), but I enjoy [Go](https://golang.org/) and also learning new languages. My favorites typically change over time.

I graduated with a BS in Mathematics &amp; Computer Science from [Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology](http://www.jkuat.ac.ke/), where I developed my love for technology and problem-solving.

Currently, I&#39;m into interpreters, how programming languages work, and distributed systems.

When I&#39;m not programming the web, I listen to music ~~and you can tell that I love Rihanna~~ ðŸ˜‰, I [write](/thoughts), travel, [read](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13682301-mr-musale), and I imagine myself exercise.">
