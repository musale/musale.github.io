I graduated with BS in Mathematics &amp; Computer Science from [Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology](http://www.jkuat.ac.ke/), where I developed my love for technology and problem solving.

I’m currently with the Automation and Data Pipelining team at [Libryo](https://libryo.com). We’re making Law easily accesible, readable and updated.

Previously, I was with [Optimetriks](https://optimetriks.com), [Gravity](https://gravity.earth), [Focus Mobile](https://smsleopard.com) where I helped to make sending bulk SMSs faster and more efficient.

When not doing server configurations, I write, travel, read, and imagine myself exercise.

Currently, I&#39;m into interpreters, compilers and how computers work.">
