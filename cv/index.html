<p>I developed an interest in programming during my time at JKUAT.

I love making simple, fast, and light solutions - and that&rsquo;s paid off during my career.</p>
<p>I enjoy <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13682301-mr-musale">reading</a> and <a href="/thoughts">writing</a>. I&rsquo;m into traveling, trying out recipes, learning new things, and making new friends. I enjoy spending time with my friends and my family. I aim to improve myself and those I influence around me.</p>
