I graduated with a BS in Mathematics &amp; Computer Science from [Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology](http://www.jkuat.ac.ke/), where I developed my love for technology and problem-solving.

I‚Äôm currently with the Automation and Data Pipelining team at [Libryo](https://libryo.com). We‚Äôre helping businesses to know their regulations by collecting, tagging, summarising, and giving them notifications when it changes.

Previously, I was with [Optimetriks](https://optimetriks.com), [Gravity](https://gravity.earth), and [Focus Mobile](https://smsleopard.com) ‚Äì where I helped to make sending bulk SMSs faster and more efficient.

When I&#39;m not programming the web, I listen to music ~~and you can tell I love Rihanna~~ üòâ, I [write](/thoughts), travel, [read](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13682301-mr-musale), and I imagine myself exercise.

Currently, I&#39;m into interpreters, how programming languages work, and distributed systems.">
