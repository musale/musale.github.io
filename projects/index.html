         <meta name="description" content="Iâ€™m Musale Martin â€“ a learner, problem-solver, and software engineer from Kenya, based in Nairobi.

I graduated with a BS in Mathematics &amp; Computer Science from [Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology](http://www.jkuat.ac.ke/), where I developed my love for technology and problem-solving.

I&#39;m currently building and breaking software at Microsoft in the 365 team.

I was previously with the Automation and Data Pipelining team at [Libryo](https://libryo.com). We were helping businesses to know their regulations by collecting, tagging, summarising, and giving them notifications when it changes.

Before that, I was with [Optimetriks](https://optimetriks.com), [Gravity](https://gravity.earth), and [Focus Mobile](https://smsleopard.com) â€“ where I helped to make sending bulk SMSs faster and more efficient.

In my free time, I contribute to open source projects. I&#39;m a maintainer at [Encode](https://www.encode.io/) where we aim to develop the highest quality open-source software. At the moment I&#39;m mostly programming in [Python](https://python.org) and [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org/), but I enjoy [Go](https://golang.org/) and also learning new languages. My favorites typically change over time.

Currently, I&#39;m into interpreters, how programming languages work, and distributed systems.

When I&#39;m not programming the web, I listen to music ~~and you can tell that I love Rihanna~~ ðŸ˜‰, I [write](/thoughts), travel, [read](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13682301-mr-musale), and I imagine myself exercise.">

    <p>Below are some small open source software projects Iâ€™ve authored or helped develop. Most of them are released under a BSD-style license. Enjoy!</p>

       <a href="hoyt/">Hoyt</a> is a theme for <a href="https://gohugo.io">Go Hugo</a> with inspiration from <a href="https://benhoyt.com/">Ben Hoyt&rsquo;s</a> personal website. It&rsquo;s still a work in <del>very slow</del> progress but it was a very good starting point for me to learn about Go Hugo and how it works as a static site generator. 
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
       <a href="txt-from-img/">txt-from-img</a> was a gentle introduction to the tessaract library and how to get text from an image in a lambda function. 
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
       <a href="aiompesa/">aiompesa</a> is a Python library that I wrote which allows you to interact with Python&rsquo;s <em>asyncio</em> library. MPESA is a service that allows you to make money transactions using your mobile phone. <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html">Asyncio</a> is a library that allows you to write concurrent code in Python using <code>async/await</code> pattern.
